### How to Approach a Coding Problem in React with Backend Integration

1. **Research and Understand the Task**

   - Before starting, research the task. Look for best practices, similar projects, and community recommendations.

2. **Decide Between Client-Side and Server-Side Execution**

   - Carefully consider what should be executed on the client vs. the server. For instance, generating a PDF might be more efficient and secure on the server.

3. **Minimize Data Exposure**

   - When sending data to the client, only send necessary data. Avoid exposing sensitive information.

4. **Selective Data Retrieval**

   - When querying data (e.g., user details), select only the fields that are necessary for the specific context.

5. **Data Validation on Both Ends**

   - Implement data validation both on the client (for user experience) and on the server (for security).

6. **Error Handling**

   - Implement robust error handling on both the frontend and backend to catch and respond to exceptions gracefully.

7. **Authentication and Authorization Checks**

   - Ensure that the user is authenticated and authorized to perform certain actions, especially on the backend.

8. **Optimize Data Loading**

   - Use techniques like lazy loading, pagination, or infinite scrolling to efficiently load and display data on the frontend.

9. **API Design and Documentation**

   - Design your API endpoints thoughtfully. Document them clearly for easy maintenance and scalability.

10. **Security Measures**

    - Implement security best practices such as input sanitization, using HTTPS, and securing API endpoints.

11. **Testing and Quality Assurance**

    - Write tests for both frontend and backend. Ensure that the application works as expected and is free from major bugs.

12. **Performance Optimization**
    - Monitor and optimize the performance of both the frontend and backend. This includes optimizing database queries, reducing bundle sizes, and implementing caching strategies.
